# 📊 Contact Center Intelligence Portfolio
**End-to-End BI, Operations, Workforce, and Quality Analysis**
## Overview
An end-to-end analytical case study of a simulated contact center operation.

This project is designed to demonstrate practical readiness for roles in:
* Data Analysis & Business Intelligence (BI)
* Process Mapping, Modelling and Improvement (BPM)
* Workforce Management (WFM) & Real-Time Analysis / Monitoring (RTM)
* Quality Assurance & Analytics (QA)

The contact center is approached as a system — balancing customer experience, cost, quality, and capacity.
This reflects how real-world BPO and enterprise contact centers operate and how data is used to support decision-making, not just reporting.

## Project Scope
The simulated operation represents:
* An **inbound support + retention** contact center
* Voice channel only (to maintain analytical clarity)
* Single-site operation
* Medium-scale workforce

The portfolio covers:
* KPI definition and goal alignment
* Operational performance analysis
* Cost and efficiency evaluation
* Quality framework and behavioral analysis
* Workforce capacity and SLA risk assessment
* Executive-level decision synthesis

## How to Navigate This Portfolio
Each folder represents a functional lens commonly found in contact centers.

You can explore this portfolio based on the role you are reviewing for:
* **BI / Reporting:** → `03_BI_and_Reporting/`
* **Operations / Process Improvement:** → `04_Operations_and_Process_Improvement/`
* **Quality / CX Analytics:** → `05_Quality_and_CX_Analytics/`

## Key Questions This Portfolio Answers
* What defines success in a contact center operation?
* Which KPIs matter most, and why?
* Where do performance and cost conflicts originate?
* How do quality frameworks impact customer experience?
* How does staffing variability affect SLA and CX?
* What decisions should leadership make under constraints?

## Notes
* All data is simulated for demonstration purposes.
* Scenarios are designed to mirror real-world constraints.
* The focus is on decision quality, not perfect metrics.
