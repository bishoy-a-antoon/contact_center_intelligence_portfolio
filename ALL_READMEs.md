Perfect. Below are **clean, professional README templates for every folder** in your portfolio.
They are written so that **any reviewer can land in any folder and immediately understand**:

* What this section is about
* Why it matters in a real contact center
* What decisions it supports

You can copy each one into its corresponding folder as `README.md`.

---

# 📁 00_Overview_and_Assumptions / README.md

## Purpose

This folder defines the **system context** for the entire portfolio.

Before analyzing KPIs, processes, workforce, or quality, it is critical to clearly define:

* What type of contact center this is
* What business goals it serves
* What constraints exist

This mirrors how real-world analysis starts: **understanding the system before measuring it**.

---

## Contents

* **Contact Center Overview**
  High-level description of the operation, channels, volumes, and structure.

* **Business Goals and Objectives**
  What success means from a business and CX perspective.

* **Assumptions and Constraints**
  Explicit assumptions used throughout the analysis to ensure transparency and consistency.

---

## Why This Matters

Operational analysis without clear assumptions often leads to:

* Misinterpreted KPIs
* Conflicting conclusions
* Unrealistic recommendations

This section ensures all downstream analysis is grounded in a shared reality.

---

# 📁 01_KPIs_and_Business_Analysis / README.md

## Purpose

This folder establishes the **analytical backbone** of the project.

It defines:

* Which KPIs are used
* Why they exist
* How they relate to business goals
* Where tradeoffs occur

KPIs are treated as **decision tools**, not vanity metrics.

---

## Contents

* **KPI Framework**
  The logic behind selecting operational, CX, quality, and workforce metrics.

* **KPI Dictionary**
  Definitions, formulas, and interpretation guidance.

* **Goal-to-Metric Mapping**
  How strategic objectives translate into measurable indicators.

* **Tradeoffs and Conflicts**
  Where KPIs naturally oppose each other (e.g., speed vs quality).

---

## Why This Matters

Many contact centers track KPIs without understanding:

* What behaviors they incentivize
* What unintended consequences they create

This section demonstrates **Business Analysis thinking**, not just reporting.

---

# 📁 02_Data / README.md

## Purpose

This folder contains the **data foundation** used across all analyses.

Data is intentionally simple, simulated, and structured to reflect realistic contact center operations.

The focus is on **how data is used**, not data volume or complexity.

---

## Structure

* **Raw_Data/**
  Simulated operational datasets as they might exist in real systems.

* **Processed_Data/**
  Cleaned, aggregated, and analysis-ready datasets.

---

## Why This Matters

Good analysis depends on:

* Understanding data limitations
* Cleaning inconsistencies
* Avoiding false precision

This section demonstrates **data discipline**, not data engineering.

---

# 📁 03_BI_and_Reporting / README.md

## Purpose

This folder represents the **Business Intelligence function**.

It focuses on:

* Monitoring performance

* **Dashboards**
  Operational and CX dashboards designed for different stakeholders.

* **Weekly Insights Report**
  Written summaries explaining what changed, why, and what to do next.

This section demonstrates analyst-level thinking beyond dashboard creation.

---

# 📁 04_Operations_and_Process_Improvement / README.md

## Purpose

This folder focuses on **how work flows through the system**.

It analyzes:

* Processes
* Bottlenecks

The goal is to improve performance **without harming CX or quality**.

---

## Contents

* **Process Mapping**
  As-Is and To-Be process representations.

* **Bottleneck Analysis**
  Identification of constraints and delay points.

* **Cost per Contact Analysis**
  High-level cost logic tied to operational behavior.

  Practical recommendations with tradeoff considerations.

---

## Why This Matters

Most performance issues are **system issues**, not people issues.

This section demonstrates:

* Operations Management thinking
* Root cause analysis
* Cost-aware decision-making

---

# 📁 05_Quality_and_CX_Analytics / README.md

## Purpose

This folder represents the **Quality and CX analytics function**.

It treats quality as:

> Measurement of customer-facing behavior — not just compliance.

The analysis connects quality scoring, scripts, sentiment, and CX outcomes.

---

## Contents

* **QA Framework**
  Definition of quality dimensions and behavioral indicators.

  Manual sentiment evaluation of sample interactions.

* **Quality vs CX Insights**
  Analysis of alignment and misalignment between quality scores and customer experience.

---

## Why This Matters

High quality scores do not always mean good customer experience.

This section demonstrates:

* **Staffing and Shrinkage Analysis**
  Understanding capacity, occupancy, and availability.

* **SLA Risk Scenarios**
  How understaffing or volume spikes affect service levels.
